# UFOs
Module 11 / JavaScript
## Overview of Project: 
The following project allows users to filter UFO sightings by date, city, state, country and shape. Users will be able to enter the values in the text boxes and after pressing "enter" the table will be updated. 
This helps users visualize the information better and makes it more friendly. 

## Results: 

According to the story board of the project, the website contains more or less 4 components. 

- Component # 1
At the top you'll see the navigation bar "UFO Sightings". 

- Component # 2 
Then there's a title with a background image. The class of the tittle is called jumbotron. Jumbotron is a big grey box used to indicate some text which requires extra attention. Any text that seems to be important can be written inside a jumbotron to make it appear big and noticeable. In addition, the project also includes a space image which I believe gives it a nice touch. 

 Jumbotron definition taken from: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bootstrap-4-jumbotron/#:~:text=A%20jumbotron%20is%20a%20big,it%20appear%20big%20and%20noticeable. 

- Component # 3 
The third component is an article title and an article paragraph that are inside a container. The container has 12 columns, 4 were assigned to the article title and 8 for the article paragraph. 

- Component # 4 
Finally there is a Table Filter and a Table. There are five list elements for filtering the data. The event listener was modified to detect when the user enters values inside the text boxes. The data is displayed in the table after being filtered based on user input. 


## Summary

While the website looks great and all components are well distributed, I believe there's still some room for improvement.

 A drawback of this design is that the user doesn't know which cities, states, countries, dates or shapes are available to be filtered. Thus I think it would be better if instead that the used enters values inside text boxes, the user selects options from a menu filter. 

Another drawback is that the text of the article is too long and though it invites the user to dig into the data, it does so at the end of the text. I believe the website would be more friendly if perhaps instead of a landing article, the user would be invited in a more interactive way to look at the data. For example something like: When was the last UFO sighting? Discover below" / The article could be placed in a section "About ME". 


In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
